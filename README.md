The Smart Home System is a computer based monitoring system designed to help with the Australian governmentâ€™s aging population problem.
The system shall help the aged care monitoring and enable them to stay in their own homes for longer hours.
It will capture and record data on both normal and irregular activities of the client concerned enabling it to monitor their wellbeing as well as alerting the stakeholders if required.

Team Bronte has been commissioned to build this system that detects changes in sensor states which occur at participating homes.
A supervisory system generates/sends reports to appropriate stakeholders and is also accessible to an operator to analyse and modify the alarm status.
Authorised users are allowed to analyse the logged data using the history records.
